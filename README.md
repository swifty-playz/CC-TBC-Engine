# Creature Collector Turn-Based Combat Engine (C)

A lightweight 2D game engine written in **C**, built specifically for **party-based creature collector turn-based combat** games.  
This project focuses on designing clean, modular systems such as creature data structures, party management, turn-based battles, encounter handling, and event scripting.

This engine is designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate skills in **C programming**, **game architecture**, **systems design**, **data-driven development**, and **modular engine structure**.
